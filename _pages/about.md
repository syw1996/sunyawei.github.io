Before joining SCIR, I received my bachelor degree in the Department of Computer Science and Technology of Harbin Institute of Technology. Here is my [cv](./cv_yaweisun_en.pdf) and [简历](./cv_yaweisun_zh.pdf).

My research interests lie in **story generation**, **data-to-text generation**, **pretrained language model**, etc.
